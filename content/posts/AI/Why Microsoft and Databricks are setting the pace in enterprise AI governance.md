**Trust is the new uptime.** At enterprise scale, AI without governance is just technical debt in disguise.

The signal is clear, governance has shifted from “compliance overhead” to growth accelerator and regulators are raising the bar [EU AI Act applicability hits in August 2026](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2025/772906/EPRS_ATA%282025%29772906_EN.pdf)

#### Why Microsoft + Databricks are setting the pace in enterprise AI governance

- **Microsoft**: independent analysts recognize Microsoft as a Leader for unified AI governance, reflecting the company’s end‑to‑end approach across data, identity, security, and compliance. In practice, that looks like **Foundry** (dev + eval + rollout), **Purview** (data security/governance), **Entra** (identity/agent identity), and **Defender** (AI‑specific posture and runtime protection) working as one control plane so compliance and safety ride along every stage of the lifecycle. [IDC](https://marketingassets.microsoft.com/gdc/gdcvb3Tx9/original), [MSFT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/01/14/microsoft-named-a-leader-in-idc-marketscape-for-unified-ai-governance-platforms/)

- **Databricks**:  **Unity Catalog** has become the governance backbone for the lakehouse era, unifying access controls, lineage, audit, and discovery for **data + ML models + notebooks/files** across clouds and engines. Add **Mosaic AI Gateway** to centralize model access/guardrails, cost/usage visibility, and payload logging—so you can run multi‑model GenAI with policy enforcement and auditability by design.

#### My Key takeaways

- **Unify controls**: One policy fabric across data, ML, GenAI, and agents beats stitched‑together point tools every time.
- **Build on governance, not around it**: Shift‑left with evaluation, safety guardrails, and policy‑as‑code in CI/CD to reduce risk and cycle time.
- **Be model and cloud agnostic**: Mix proprietary and open models behind a single gateway with consistent logging and guardrails.
- **Prepare for regulation**: Map controls to frameworks (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001) and prove it with evidence and audit trails.
