If or when valuations reset, the winners will be the teams that already moved from AI theatre to measurable resilience.

My key takeaways and actions from the [World Economic Forum analysis](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/10/is-the-ai-cyber-bubble-about-to-burst/):
* Over‑reliance on a few hyperscaler‑centric stacks amplifies systemic and geopolitical exposure. Diversify now and look into multi‑cloud/sovereign options, portability, exit clauses.
* Deepfakes, identity fraud and misinformation will drive losses and compliance costs more than exotic zero‑days.
* Identity, patching, third‑party risk and secure SDLC out‑perform speculative “AI security” add‑ons in downturns. Tie spend to risk‑reduction and time‑to‑recover.
* Run a vendor‑concentration drill, re‑balance cyber capex (70/20/10: core controls / modernization / bets), and adjust KPIs accordingly.
